# MIDAS TASK
Hello, I am Aviral and I am a junior undergraduate at DTU,Delhi.
This is a simple web app for the Engineering Track Task for Midas IIITD.

## üë®‚Äçüíª FEATURES
- A State of the Art Web Design 
- Custom Authentication with special tags for incorrect credentials, and incomplete fields
- Successfully deployed on Heroku [App Link](https://midas-web-task-aviral.herokuapp.com/)
- Fully Responsive for large and medium screens.
- NOTE TO THE REVIEWER - I am assuming the given website design was for large and medium screens as the given design was not possible to implement on small screens.

## ‚öõ Tech Stack
- Frontend : HTML(EJS), CSS, Bootstrap  
    - INTUITION : EJS would have allowed me to use Javascript within my HTML code which would help me do animations and do toggling of buttons with ease.
- Backend : NodeJS, Express
    - INTUITION : Node and Express would help in providing better code efiiciency , speed and performance . Moreover, since Node and Express are used majorly within the developer community, it is easy to look out for technical snags if we hit one.
- Database : MongoDB
    - INTUITION : Although the use of MySQL and MongoDB would not have impacted much here , I used MongoDB to get a tad better speed and performance due to the key pair logic for the faster retrieval of the data.

## üíª Run the project locally
- Clone the repo ```https://github.com/aviralx10/Midas-Web-App-Task.git```
- Navigate to the app using terminal.
- Run command to install all the dependencies ```npm install``` 
- Run command to start the server ```node app.js```
- Navigate to ```http://localhost:3000/```

## :frowning_face:Problems Encountered
- One of the main challenges was to implement the shape of the blob as shown in the Design File. I had to scan through various resources and go through a lot of effort in order to make the blob.
- While deploying to heroku, I encountered various issues with my authorisation as Heroku had discontunued the addon for MongoDB, I had to connect MongoDB Atlas with my server and had to do some changes for the same.
